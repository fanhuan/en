As  you can easily see, English is not my native language. There are many words that I have encountered numerous times in my life, and usually I have a vague idea of what they mean. But usually due to no exact matching word in my mother tough, it stays as some cloudy murky blob. One such word is 'orthogonal'. Recently, I finally made the effort to understand what it means and where it came from, and life actually has became slightly better! Therefore I decided to take more time to understand some re-occurring words better so I like this world a bit more.

Today let's try deterministic and stochastic. 

We all know what determine and determined means. When a model is deterministic, it usually means that in that the same input it will always produce the same prediction, no stochastic processes are involved.
