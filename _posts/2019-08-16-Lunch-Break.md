__Title:__ [Host diet and evolutionary history explain different aspects of gut microbiome diversity among vertebrate clades](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10191-3)

__Who:__ Youngblut from Max Plank ([Ley Lab](https://www.leylab.com/), yes the famous Ley from the 2008 Science paper) and Reischer from Vienna (Farnleitner Lab).

__Where and Whenï¼š__ Nature Communication, May 2019

__Take home message:__

- Evolutionary history and diet modulates different aspects of diversity.
- Mammalia have a stronger signal of cophylogeny.
- environmental filtering and microbe-microbe interactions differ among host clades.

__Novelty__
- Wide evolutionary scale: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish

__Umm moments__

- 16s based
