A major part of my UW thesis is on reconstructing phylogeny from raw reads, without either assembly or alignment. I call this method assembly and alignment free (AAF) and one of my [github repo](https://github.com/fanhuan/AAF) is dedicated to it.

This year I started using this method on metagenomic data for clustering of different samples. Since the relationship between those samples are probably not tree-like, a NMDS plot might make more sense (this was initially done by Dr. Camila Carlos).
