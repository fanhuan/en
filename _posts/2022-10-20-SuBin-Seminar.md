Cross-species 3D Genome comparison among human, macaque and mouse

TAD: Topologically associating domain

The human-gained __TAD__ boundaries are enriched with evolutionarily young transposable elements.

HSLs: The human-specific chromatin __loops__: mainly E-E

Loop type: Promotor-P, P-Enhancer, E-E

聚焦到一个基因：EPHA7, 大脑发育相关，神经细胞dendrite length改变，

总结：
原材料

Q: imaging genetics (MRI)
A: high resolution, the higher the better. Break-through expected in a couple of years. Monkey, 11T, but they move so need to be put to sleep and it might affect the imaging. 7T, human, Fudan University. 

Q: 染色体的融合断裂
A: 黑猩猩的2号3号染色体融合成了人类的2号染色体（很大），肯定会对TAD有很大的影响。上周刚发了一篇人工合成染色体的文章。
