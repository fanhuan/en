This happens when you have some genomes, and cannot say no to the gene sequences from other samples, since you might not be sequencing them for now or forever. 

Here is a demonstration for how to fish out LSU (large sub-unit) genes out of Escovopsis (my new client) genome. 

Input: LSU from another strain of Escovopsis. This could be downloaded from NCBI. I asked for one from an undergrad who is doing LSU sequencing of them.
