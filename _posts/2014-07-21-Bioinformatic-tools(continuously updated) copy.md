This is a continously updated note about newly published bioinformatic tools. More will be said after trying to use them. Any comments on any of the topics or tools are appreciated.

#GWAS:

#### [Covariate-modulated local false discovery rate for genome-wide association studies](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/15/2098.abstract.html?etoc) 
Method: SNPs from categories enriched for non-null associations have a lower fdr for a given value of a test statistic than SNPs in unenriched categories.
Test dataset: Eight Crohnâ€™s disease substudies as independent training and test datasets.
