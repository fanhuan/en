###  Figure out your UUID

`$ sudo blkid`

### Followed instructions from [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/352752/how-to-access-drives-that-are-mounted-by-other-users)

Note that you need to choose a proper format for your file system. 'vfat' might not work for you. If you don't know which one to use, you can set it to "auto".

### restart the computer. 

`$ df -h`
