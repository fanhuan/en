I attened one of the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) workshop (same place that I learnt about for loop in R being really inefficient), and python was 1/4 of it (about half a day). They forced us to use python 3.*!

I was still with the absolutely obslete opinion that python 3.* is not ready and we should stick to python 2.7. While in order to follow the instructor in the workshop, I started my experience with python 3.5.1 (holy crap, when did it get to 3.5?!) totally unprepared. And I was expecting the worst.

But it worked out fine. The only annoying thing I could remember is that you have to put things you want to print in paranthesis.

In python 2.*

	print "Hello World!"

While in python 3.*

	print("Hello World!")
	
And the rest is just fine! I'm ready for python 3.*, I think!

Damn, no Biopython for python 3.5!

Simrlls requires python 2.7...

Should I switch back to python 2.7?
